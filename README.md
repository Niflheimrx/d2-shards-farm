# Destiny 2 Legendary Shards Farm
This is a simple AutoHotkey script that allows you to farm Legendary Shards through the collections menu with ease on any class.

# Important Notice
Just like any macro or virtual input device, you put yourself at risk by using this macro. I am not responsible for what happens to your account. [Please refer to the Code of Conduct](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049202731)

### What does it do?
This script will only farm legendary shards from the collections menu and nothing else. You will need to obtain the required glimmer from Rahool manually. It was designed this way to prevent abuse of this script for avoiding AFK bans, which is bannable. It will navigate the menus using precise window coordinates and click items when necessary.

### Why use this over Tiny Task?
While Tiny Task is easier in terms of setting it up for your own needs (and for general autoclicker purposes), this macro has been set up so it will always work as long as you follow the simple instructions below. I've also had reports of Tiny Task compromising Steam accounts and installing keyloggers. This script only uses AutoHotkey and nothing else so it's pretty safe.

## Before starting the script:
Install AutoHotkey, [you can click here for the latest v1 build](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe) (**Note: You need to have v1 installed**)   
In order to increase the effectiveness of this script, you need to prepare yourself by doing the following:
- Entering Fullscreen Windowed by using Alt+Enter, then running at a resolution of 1360 x 768
- Only having 1 legging in your characters' inventory, this script will delete all leggings that are not currently equipped
- Having atleast 240k glimmer ready to spend, this script will loop 90 times before finishing.
- You need to be in orbit, there is currently a problem where if you are in the tower you may experience long loading times from the D2 API.

## How do I use it?
1) Make sure you are setup for this script, **IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU RUN THE GAME AT 1360 x 768 ON FULLSCREEN WINDOWED**
2) Open D2Shards.ahk, you should have the AutoHotkey icon in your taskbar when loaded.
3) Go to your characters' inventory screen (Default: I)
4) Press F7 to start the script
5) Watch the script automate the farming process for you.

## How to stop the script:
If you want to stop the farming process or something has gone wrong, you can do either the following:
- Press F7 again, it will stop the script when it goes to the next screen/menu
- Go to the AutoHotkey icon in your taskbar, right click it and click on 'Exit'
- Go
